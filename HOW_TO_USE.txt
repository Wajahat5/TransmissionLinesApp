Please note that the app will run perfectly only when all the functions are within the same folder as the .mlapp file.
To use the app simply open the ‘TransmissionLinesCalculator.mlapp’ in matlab and run it.
Note: In many situation the value zero will not be shown as zero but as a very small value, for eg. 1.2*e^-88.
